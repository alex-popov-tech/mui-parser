# Aside Section Detector

Detects `<aside>` HTML elements as structural sections for page layout namespacing.

The aside section serves as a namespace container, grouping all elements within an `<aside>` tag under a common parent in the parsed tree. This is useful for distinguishing sidebar content from main content.
